## Description
This raspberry pi will use a ~~[Hifiberry](https://www.hifiberry.com/) hat~~ (now it's using a USB DAC) to play high quality audio received via Airplay using [shairport](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) or Spotify connect via [raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify). It also runs mpd and is used to play streams controlled by remote clients such as `vinylstreamer`

## Required files

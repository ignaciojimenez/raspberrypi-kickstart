## Description
This raspberry pi will contain a [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) dns blackholing device which will act as the local dns server, dhcp server, and that will act as the default gateway for devices in the local network and route their traffic through a protonvpn tunnel

## Required files
None

## TODO
- [x] ~~Modify setupVars.conf to change default gateway to its own IP when copying it~~ (Not tested IRL yet)
